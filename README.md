# Status page with Hugo Website on AWS S3

This project is a static website built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and flexible static site generator written in Go. The site is deployed and hosted on **Amazon S3**, taking advantage of its scalability and low-cost storage for static assets.

CState is an open-source status page template built with Hugo. It's designed to help you create a simple, beautiful, and static status page — ideal for showing the current uptime of your services, listing past incidents, and sharing maintenance updates.

It works just like the status pages used by GitHub, Cloudflare, or Atlassian — but it's free, self-hosted, and doesn’t require a backend. Everything is rendered as static HTML, CSS, and JS.

## 📈 What Can You Do with CState?
- Display real-time service status (e.g., operational, degraded, down).
- Publish incident history and updates.
- Customize the UI and theming.
- Integrate deployments with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.
- Host your status page anywhere static files are supported (S3, GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)

## 🚀 Features

- ⚡ Built with Hugo for lightning-fast performance
- ☁️ Hosted on Amazon S3 with static website hosting enabled
- 🔁 CI/CD ready (GitHub Actions)
- 📂 Clean and organized content structure
- 🟢 It’s cost-effective and scales automatically.
